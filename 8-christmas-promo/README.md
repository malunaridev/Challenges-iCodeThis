![Introduction](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-Introduction.png)

Ok, I'm pretty SURPRISED of how this challenge turned out to be the most awesome challenge I ever done. 
It was because it was the simplest one, but I have implemented some few raw JavaScript I have learned, and now it is probably my favorite challenge ever.

I have no words to say how proud I am for doing this.
I mean, for you probably it's a simple thing that you can do with your eyes closed.
But for me, it was an awesome experience!
Finally using some JavaScript for a challenge means I have learned at least what is necessary to hide/show a div. 
I'm pretty happy!
