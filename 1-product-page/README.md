![Introduction](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-Introduction.png)

This was my very first project using JavaScript! I was really excited to try something like this, even if I am too early in my DOM studies. I tried to realize some small things, before searching or studying for it, because it helps me to get deeper in my code studies. The HTML and CSS parts where "easy", and I spent some time building the script and getting it clean.

![What I Have Learned](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-What-I-have-learned.png)

As my first project with JavaScript, I felt very happy when the buttons actually worked! Do you remember your first time using JavaScript, right? Yes, I was feeling the same. I expect to apply scripts into my old projects too, and all projects from now on.
