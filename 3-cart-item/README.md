And now, the third challenge! It's been a really fun journey!
This one was by far the easiest until now: I guess I've spent around 40 minutes with no hurry, and I glady did not have to search or study anything. I guess that is a sign of improvement!

Not many new things on this project! I was able to finally build this one with no need to search or study anything new. It makes me really happy at this point, because it means I am getting close of where I want to reach!
