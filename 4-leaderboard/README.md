![Introduction](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-Introduction.png)

Ok, about the fourth challenge: the most difficult one until now! I have a lot of trouble trying to figure out if I should use <code>ul</code> or <code>button</code>, and I tried both. This one was indeed a challenge!

![What I have learned](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-What-I-have-learned.png)

It was my frist time using tables like this, and algo first time using pseudoelements! I was expecting something bad at the end, but I was surprised when it actually worked out really well! I learned about <code>tr:not(:first-child):hover</code>, for example, it was totally new to me. I needed a hover that works for every row, except the first one, and I found and studied this selector. It was really fun!
