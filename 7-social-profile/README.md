![Introduction](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-Introduction.png)

The challenge #07 was a easy one, and there was not much to learn about. I think this is a good sign, meaning that I have less and less to search every time.

![What I have learned](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-What-I-have-learned.png)

I have learned from a friend the trick about using <code>position: relative</code>, then repositioning the div the way I wanted. It turned out to be really useful when you already have a layout (as an example, the <code>display:flex</code>) but wants to literally "unalign" something.
