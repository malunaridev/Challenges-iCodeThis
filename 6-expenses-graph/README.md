Its been such a fun journey!
The challenge #06 took me some time to start, because I wanted to do something using external resources. I could not find something useful for my case, maybe because I did not know how to style them, or just because it was a little extra complicated for me. My solution was to build it with the knowledge I already have, so I ended up using CSS and HTML only.

All the basics used again. This time, I've built the graph using divs as "shapes". I'm planning to implement some JavaScript later.
