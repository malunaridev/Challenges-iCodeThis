The second challenge from iCodeThis was a mobile menu! It was really interesting how the UI behavior was represented, even if I don't really understand the point of the bottom close button. Probably this menu is supposed to be a drop-down, and, with my current knowledge, I still cannot build it. I hope I will learn it soon!

This kind of menu was really challenging for me because of the border, in which I spent a lot of time! I had trouble considering how the <code>border-left</code> affected the buttons when hovering the elements. I realized that I needed to reduce the space inside, so the content would not be pushed out of the container. I was pretty proud that I had no help during the process of coding and could solve a problem by myself at this point!
