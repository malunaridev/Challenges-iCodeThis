![Introduction](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-Introduction.png)

This is the first challenge from iCodeThis!
I found iCodeThis when I was randomly looking for a daily challenge to keep me coding everyday. Since I want to keep up my GitHub activity, I was really glad when I finally found an active community for daily challenges, but they were around Challenge #104, I guess. I took a look at their past challenges and I found myself really excited to participate, so I joined one. It was really fun, and then I've decided to start from #01! I can do more than 1 per day, so I expect to keep up with the community soon.

![What I have learned](./assets/Readme-files/Readme-What-I-have-learned.png)

It was really interesting to apply classes to images. I needed square ones to save me more time, so i searched for "icons". They are supposed to be profile pictures, and I randomly choose some that matchs the color. I guess it helps with the visuals.
Also, it was my first time using an icon next to a input form, so I had some trouble to center the arrow. It worked out well with the <code>display: table-cell</code> and it was new to me.
